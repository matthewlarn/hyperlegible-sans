    Hyperlegible Sans is a free and open-source sans serif typeface designed with legibility as the primary goal. It is intended for interfaces, long-form reading, and accessibility-sensitive contexts where clear letterforms and consistent spacing matter more than stylistic expression.

    The design emphasizes distinct shapes for commonly confused characters, generous apertures, and stable proportions across weights. Letterforms are drawn to reduce ambiguity between similar glyphs such as I, l, and 1, as well as O and 0. Numerals are designed for clarity in data-heavy environments, and punctuation is sized and spaced for reliable scanning at small text sizes.

    Hyperlegible Sans is suitable for use in user interfaces, dashboards, documentation, and reading experiences where cognitive load and visual clarity are important considerations. The family includes multiple weights and italics, with consistent metrics to support predictable layout behavior across styles.

    The project builds on established open-source typography practices and is designed to integrate cleanly into modern font production and distribution workflows. Development prioritizes transparency, maintainability, and broad compatibility across platforms.
